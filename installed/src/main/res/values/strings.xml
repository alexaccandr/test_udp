    <string name="large_text"><b>Overview of Google Play Instant</b>\n\nGoogle Play Instant enables
        native apps and games to launch on devices running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher
        without being installed. You can build these types of experiences, called instant apps and
        instant games, using Android Studio. By allowing users to run an instant app or instant
        game, known as providing an instant experience, you improve your app or game\'s discovery,
        which helps drive more active users or installations.\n\n<b>How the instant experience works</b>
        \n\nWith Google Play Instant, users can tap on a button in the Play Store, Google Play Games
        app, or a website banner to use an app or game without installing it first.\nWhen Google
        Play receives one of these requests for an instant app or game, it sends the necessary files
        to the Android device that sent the request. The device then runs the app or game.\nInstant
        experiences fall into two categories: Try experiences in the Play Store and Instant play
        games in the Google Play Games app.\n\n<b>Enable instant experiences by reducing app or game
            size</b>\n\nYour app or game must be under 15 MB to enable these instant experiences,
        but the smaller you make it, the better it will be for users.\nReducing the size of your
        instant app or game has a number of benefits including:\n- Higher user engagement or
        installations and business success\n-Enabling all instant surfaces including the Try now
        button in the Play Store\n-Instant play homepage featuring in the Google Play Games app\n
